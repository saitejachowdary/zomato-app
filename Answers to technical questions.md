Front-End Interview Technical Questions

1.1	For completing the Coding assignment, I almost spent 8 hours.

1.2	I am hoping that I met all the requirements & Acceptance criteria, If I have Some more time to implement the Application, I would like to add more techniques related to Accessibility Criteria.

2.  The most useful feature I used here was redux-thunk, it is a middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. Thunk is also used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. 

3. API failing from back-end causes performance issues in production, I faced this issues when I’m Dealing with an application which has Currency API was not triggered and component depend’s on that API was not displayed.

4. We can improve the API by accessing more data which is useful to clients using Queries.
